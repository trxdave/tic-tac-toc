In this digital rendition of the game, you'll be facing off against an AI opponent represented by 'üò†', while you'll be '‚ùå'. The rules are simple: strategically place your mark in an empty cell by entering a number from 1 to 9, corresponding to the position on the board.

Here's a quick overview of the game rules:

The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
If all the cells are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Flowchart ##

 The Tic-Tac-Toe game begins by asking the player to choose between X or O, after which both the player and computer take turns making moves.

The flowcharts on the left demonstrate the series of events that occur during the player's turn, while the ones on the right represent what takes place during the computer's turn. Once the player or computer has made a move, the program checks whether they have won or caused a tie, and then switches turns. 
After the game is complete, the program prompts the player to decide whether they would like to play again.
