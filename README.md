# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction ##

Are you up for a game of Tic Tac Toe against a computer? It's a timeless game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to align three of your marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

In this digital version of the game, you'll be playing against an AI opponent represented by 'üò†', while you'll be '‚ùå'. To play, you just need to strategically place your mark in an empty cell by entering a number from 1 to 9, corresponding to the position on the board.

Here are the game rules:

- The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- If all the cells are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

Get ready to exercise your tactical skills and experience the thrill of victory in this classic game of Tic Tac Toe!

### Colours ###

- Green: Used for the welcome message and player prompts.
- Yellow: Used for game instructions and important information about the game.
- Cyan: Used for displaying the Tic Tac Toe board and numerical grid positions.
- Red: Used for error messages or warnings.
- Reset: Used to reset the color back to default after displaying colored text.

These colors are implemented using the Colorama library in Python, which allows for easy cross-platform colored text output in the console. You can customize the colors or add more as per your preference by modifying the code.

## Features ##

### Welcome Message and Introduction: ###

- Upon starting the game, the player is greeted with a stylish header and a brief introduction to the game's rules and mechanics.
- The system asks the user to provide their name and ensures that only alphabetic characters are accepted.

### Printing the Game Board: ###

- The 'print_board()' function displays the current state of the Tic Tac Toe game board to the player.
- It shows the positions on the board with numbers for player reference.

### Game Logic: ###

- The function checks the board state to determine the winner or if it's a draw and if the game is over. 
- It checks for winning conditions in rows, columns, and diagonals, as well as for a draw condition.

### Computer Move: ###

- This function is responsible for executing the logic that determines the computer player's move.
- After checking if the computer can win on its next move, if not, it blocks the player from winning, and if neither, it makes a random move.

### Main Game Loop ###

- The main() function is responsible for managing the game's flow.
- It prompts the player for their name, displays the introduction, and begins a new game repeatedly.
- Each game consists of alternating, player and computer turns until a win or draw.
- At the end of every game, the system prompts the player to ask if they would like to play again.

### Input Validation: ###

- It ensures that the player's input for their name and moves are valid.
- Name input only accepts alphabetic characters.
- Move input only accepts integers from 1 to 9 and checks if the chosen position is empty.

### Styling with Colorama: ###

- The colorama library is used for coloring the console output, enhancing the visual appeal of the game.
- Different colors are used for headers, prompts, and game status messages, making them more distinguishable and engaging.
