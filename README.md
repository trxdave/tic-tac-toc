# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction ##

Tic Tac Toe is a game that I created with confidence and proficiency, as my Portfolio Project 3. It is built using pure Python and an extensive collection of libraries to elevate its functionality. The game can be enjoyed in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku with seamless ease. The main goal of the game is to strategically place three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to triumph and emerge victorious.

### Colours ###

The Python Colorama Package provides the colors used in the game and allows them to be applied to the text in the terminal environment.

## Flowchart ##

 The Tic-Tac-Toe game begins by asking the player to choose between X or O, after which both the player and computer take turns making moves.

The flowcharts on the left demonstrate the series of events that occur during the player's turn, while the ones on the right represent what takes place during the computer's turn. Once the player or computer has made a move, the program checks whether they have won or caused a tie, and then switches turns. 
After the game is complete, the program prompts the player to decide whether they would like to play again.
