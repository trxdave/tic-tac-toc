# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction ##

Are you up for a game of Tic Tac Toe against a computer? It's a timeless game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to align three of your marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

In this digital version of the game, you'll be playing against an AI opponent represented by 'üò†', while you'll be '‚ùå'. To play, you just need to strategically place your mark in an empty cell by entering a number from 1 to 9, corresponding to the position on the board.

Here are the game rules:

- The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- If all the cells are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

Get ready to exercise your tactical skills and experience the thrill of victory in this classic game of Tic Tac Toe!
